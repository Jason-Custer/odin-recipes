# odin-recipes
This is where I am building a recipe project from scratch with HTML. I will be following The Odin Project as I build and update this website with CSS and JavaScript in the future.

My hope is to learn how to use Git to commmit as I build this website, to slowly make it more responsive and aesthetically pleasing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to make it more of my own as I get more skills in web development.
