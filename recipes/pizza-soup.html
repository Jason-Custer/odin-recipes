    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>An easy soup that tastes like pizza!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs</li>
        <li>1 TBS Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 sweet potato, peeled and cubbed into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped (from a jar of sun dried tomatoes in oil)</li>
        <li>1/2 TBS dried oregano or Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock </li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If your slow cooker has a sauté function, turn it on (otherwise, just add all ingredients to crockpot). Once heated, add oil, white onion, and sweet potato. Sauté for 3 minutes. Add garlic and sauté until garlic is fragrant, about one minute. </li>
        <li>Add the spices and sun-dried tomatoes. Mix to combine. Place chicken in the slow cooker. Add chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Place lid on slow cooker. For fresh chicken, place on high for 3 hours or low for 6 hours. For frozen chicken, place on high for 4-5 hours or on low for 7-8 hours. </li>
        <li>Once finished, remove the chicken to a bowl and shred (you can do this with two forks or with a mixer). </li>
        <li>Add chicken back to the slow cooker. Add the cream and the Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine. </li>
        <li>If you want your soup a little thicker, in a separate small bowl mix together 1 TBS arrowroot or cornstarch with 1 TBS water. Once combined, stir into the soup. Be sure to stir the soup so the thickening mixture is incorporated throughout the whole soup and does not clump. Allow to cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with fresh shredded Parmesan cheese, fresh parsley, and red pepper flakes!</li>
    </ol>
